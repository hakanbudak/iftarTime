# Iftar Time Countdown Application

Welcome to the Iftar Time Countdown Application! This tool helps users to keep track of the remaining time until Iftar during the holy month of Ramadan. Built with efficiency and simplicity in mind, it provides an easy-to-use interface for accessing Iftar times based on your location.

## Features

- **Live Countdown:** Displays a live countdown to Iftar, helping you prepare in advance.
- **Location-Based Times:** Utilizes your current location to provide accurate Iftar times.
- **Daily Updates:** Updates Iftar times daily to ensure accuracy throughout Ramadan.

## APIs Used

This project leverages two key APIs to provide accurate and location-specific Iftar times:

1. **Namaz Vakti API:** Used to fetch prayer times, including Iftar (Maghrib), based on the user's location.
2. **GeoJS API (get.geojs.io):** Determines the user's current location to provide location-specific Iftar times.

## Getting Started

To use this application, simply visit [Iftar Time Countdown Application](https://iftarsaati.vercel.app/). The application will automatically fetch your current location and display the countdown to Iftar.
